### Objectives
- To prepare and transform raw data for analysis using joins and calculated fields.
- To analyze sales, profit, and returns across different markets and categories.
- To visualize time-based trends for sales, profit, and quantity.
- To evaluate customer segment contribution to total sales.
- To identify the relationship between sales and quantity.
- To design interactive dashboards with filters, navigation, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
- To provide a downloadable report experience for end users.
### Process
1. Data Source & Integration
   Used the Global Superstore dataset and joined Orders with Returns using a left join.
2. Data Cleaning
   Checked and handled duplicates, missing values, and data consistency issues.
3. Data Transformation
   Created calculated fields such as Profit Ratio and Category Code.
4. Visualization Development
   Built charts to analyze sales, profit, quantity, segments, correlations, and returns.
5. Dashboard Design & Interactivity
   Designed interactive dashboards with KPIs, year filters, navigators, and download options.
### Tools
- Microsoft Excel workbook: Data cleaning and validation.
- Tableau Desktop: Data preparation, visualizations and dashboards.
### Key Insights
- APAC leads in sales, but markets like EU and Canada show better profit ratios, indicating margin optimization opportunities.
- The Consumer segment contributes the highest share of total sales, making it the primary revenue driver.
- Sales and quantity are positively correlated, but high sales do not always guarantee high profit due to discounting or cost factors.
